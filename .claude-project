Technology: Plain HTML/CSS/JS with modern CSS features (Cards 2.0)
Deployment: GitHub Pages (static file hosting, no build process)
Content Management: JSON files for dynamic content (updates, highlights)

Current Status: Legacy "MICCAI Educational Initiative" site
Target Status: Professional MSB organization website with modern card-based design

=== APPROVED DESIGN DIRECTION ===

Direction B: Modern Card-Based Layout (Cards 2.0 Enhancement)

Focus on visual hierarchy and promotional content with enhanced card-based sections.
MSB presented as umbrella organization; initiatives showcased as distinct programs.

Key Design Elements:
- Hero section with MSB branding and tagline
- Cards 2.0: Modern webkit features (glassmorphism, smooth transitions, gradients)
- Responsive grid layout for programs, updates, and highlights
- Light/Dark mode toggle with theme persistence
- Sticky navigation with mobile hamburger menu
- Professional, welcoming aesthetic suitable for student organization
- JSON-driven dynamic content for easy maintenance

Cards 2.0 Features:
- CSS Grid layouts with responsive breakpoints
- Glassmorphism effects (backdrop-filter, semi-transparency)
- Layered box-shadows for depth
- Smooth hover transitions and scale effects
- Gradient borders and accents
- Modern webkit features with graceful degradation
- Adaptive styling for light/dark modes
- Interactive states and micro-animations

Rationale: Primary goal is promoting MSB activities to MICCAI community members.
Enhanced card layout provides clear visual separation and showcases breadth of programs.

=== CODING CONVENTIONS ===

HTML:
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, article, footer)
- Indent with 2 spaces (no tabs)
- Always include DOCTYPE, proper head/body structure
- Self-closing tags use /> for consistency
- Attribute order: class, id, data-*, src/href, other attributes
- All images must have alt attributes
- Use aria-* attributes where needed for accessibility
- IMPORTANT: Body tag must wrap all content, not appear at end

CSS:
- Indent with 2 spaces
- Use kebab-case for class names (e.g., card-container, hero-section)
- BEM naming for components: block__element--modifier
- Group related rules together with comments
- Properties alphabetically ordered within rule
- Mobile-first media queries
- Use CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for all theming
- Avoid !important unless absolutely necessary
- Use modern CSS features (Grid, Flexbox, backdrop-filter, etc.)

JavaScript:
- Use modern ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Indent with 2 spaces
- Use strict mode
- camelCase for variables and functions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Prefer vanilla JS over jQuery for new code
- Store preferences in localStorage (theme, etc.)

File Naming:
- Lowercase with hyphens for multi-word files
- Descriptive names (materials.html not mat.html)
- CSS files named after component/page
- JS files named after functionality
- JSON data files in data/ directory

=== STYLE GUIDE ===

Typography:
- Current: Multiple Google Fonts (Roboto, Merriweather Sans, Open Sans, Noto Sans)
- Proposed: Consolidate to 1-2 fonts for performance
  - Headings: Roboto (300, 400, 500 weights)
  - Body: Merriweather Sans OR system font stack
  - Monospace: System monospace stack for code
- Line heights: 1.5 for body, 1.2 for headings
- Responsive font sizing using clamp() or media queries

Colors:
- Palette: Range of blues with aesthetic flexibility
- Primary Blue: (TBD - to be determined in Phase 3)
- Accent Red: #B43757 (current highlight color)
- Text Light Mode: #000000 on #FFFFFF
- Text Dark Mode: #FFFFFF on #1A1A1A
- Background Light: #FFFFFF (content), #EEEEEE (page)
- Background Dark: #1A1A1A (content), #0D0D0D (page)
- Borders Light: #AAAAAA
- Borders Dark: #333333

Implementation:
- All colors defined as CSS custom properties
- Two sets: --color-* for light mode, overridden in [data-theme="dark"]
- Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text)
- Consider blue color psychology: trust, professionalism, calm

Layout:
- Current: Fixed 960px width
- Target: Responsive with max-width 1200px
- Container padding: 20px mobile, 40px desktop
- Breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 0-768px
  - Tablet: 769px-1024px
  - Desktop: 1025px+
- Use CSS Grid for card layouts (auto-fit, minmax)
- Use Flexbox for navigation and smaller components
- Maintain consistent spacing scale

Spacing Scale (base unit: 8px):
- xs: 4px
- sm: 8px
- md: 16px
- lg: 24px
- xl: 32px
- xxl: 48px
- xxxl: 64px

Cards 2.0 Styling:
- Border radius: 12px (cards), 8px (buttons)
- Box shadow layers:
  - Light: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)
  - Dark: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.3), 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)
- Hover: transform: translateY(-4px), enhanced shadow
- Transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
- Glassmorphism: backdrop-filter: blur(10px), rgba backgrounds
- Gradient accents: subtle linear-gradients for borders/overlays

=== LIGHT/DARK MODE IMPLEMENTATION ===

Technical Approach:
- CSS custom properties for all colors
- HTML attribute: <html data-theme="light|dark">
- JavaScript toggle button in header
- localStorage persists user preference
- Default: light mode
- No build process required

CSS Structure:
:root {
  /* Light mode colors (default) */
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  /* Dark mode color overrides */
}

JavaScript:
- Check localStorage on page load
- Apply saved theme or default to light
- Toggle button switches data-theme attribute
- Save preference to localStorage
- Smooth transition between modes

=== IMPLEMENTATION PHASES ===

PHASE 1: Foundation (Critical fixes + responsive foundation)
Status: In Progress
Complexity: Low-Medium

Tasks:
- [x] Create .claude-project documentation file
- [ ] Fix HTML structure (move body tag to proper position in all files)
- [ ] Add viewport meta tags to all pages
- [ ] Convert HTTP font imports to HTTPS in style.css
- [ ] Create base responsive CSS foundation
- [ ] Establish CSS custom properties for colors and theming

PHASE 2: Rebranding (MSB identity and content restructure)
Status: Not started
Complexity: Medium

PHASE 3: Homepage Redesign (Cards 2.0 layout implementation)
Status: Not started
Complexity: High

Tasks:

- [ ] Performance audit and improvements
- [ ] Accessibility audit (WAVE, Lighthouse)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile device testing

=== TECHNICAL DEBT ===

Priority 1 (Critical - Phase 1):
- [ ] Fix HTML structure: body tag at end of file instead of wrapping content
- [ ] Add viewport meta tags: all pages missing mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Fix mixed content: HTTP font imports cause warnings on HTTPS
- [ ] Create responsive CSS foundation

Priority 2 (High - Phase 2):
- [ ] Extract duplicate navigation: same markup repeated across 7 HTML files
- [ ] Implement responsive CSS: fixed 960px width not mobile-friendly
- [ ] Remove inline styles: scattered style attributes in HTML
- [ ] Fix semantic HTML: improve heading hierarchy and structure
- [ ] Remove brain background logo from non-MEC pages

Priority 3 (Medium - Phase 3/4):
- [ ] Optimize large images: 34 images over 1MB (performance impact)
- [ ] Update dependencies: Semantic UI 2.4.1 is outdated
- [ ] Lazy load images: implement native loading="lazy"
- [ ] Consolidate fonts: 4 Google Fonts is excessive

Priority 4 (Low - Phase 4):
- [ ] Minify assets: unminified CSS/JS files (optional)
- [ ] Consider modern formats: WebP images with fallbacks (optional)

=== DEPENDENCIES ===

Current (Runtime):
- Semantic UI 2.4.1 (CSS framework) - CDN
- Font Awesome 4.7.0 (icons) - CDN
- jQuery (multiple versions, needs consolidation)
- Google Fonts (Roboto, Open Sans, Noto Sans, Merriweather Sans) - CDN
- Facebook SDK (social media integration)
- FullCalendar 6.1.9 (events page only)

Proposed Changes:
- Keep Semantic UI for now (consider removal in future)
- Update to Font Awesome 6.x or use CSS-only icons
- Consolidate to single jQuery version or remove
- Reduce to 1-2 Google Fonts
- Keep Facebook SDK and FullCalendar

Development Tools (Phase 4, optional):
- Image optimization: Sharp, Squoosh, or TinyPNG (manual)
- Code formatting: Prettier (optional, local only)
- Linting: ESLint, Stylelint (optional, local only)

Decision: Keep dependencies minimal. No npm/build process for deployment.
All dev tools are local/optional for code quality only.
