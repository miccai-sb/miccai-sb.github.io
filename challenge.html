    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The MICCAI Educational Challenge will be held for the third time, kicking off at MICCAI 2017 and concluding at MICCAI 2018.</p>

<p>The goal of the challenge is to encourage members of the MICCAI community to create and share educational materials, covering fundamental concepts in medical image computing and computer-assisted interventions.</p>

<p>The winner of the MICCAI Educational Challenge will receive a prize of $500, sponsored by the MICCAI society. The winner will be announced at MICCAI 2018.</p>

<p><strong>New in 2017:</strong> Tutorials may be formatted as papers, presentations or blog posts.</p>

  <h1>Motivation</h1>

<p>There are many fundamental concepts unique to medical image computing and computer-assisted interventions. However, finding good sources can be difficult, whether you are a new student or an established researcher exploring a new topic.</p>

<p>With the MICCAI Educational Challenge, we hope to build a library of tutorials relevant to the MICCAI community and created by its members. Establishing a comprehensive collection will make the field more accessible and shorten the startup time for new students. The MEC will be repeated at future MICCAI conferences, building a large corpus of educational resources for the community.</p>

<p>We received 13 submissions, and 4 finalists were chosen by expert reviewers.</p>

<h1> How to participate</h1>

<p>You have complete flexibility in choosing the format of your tutorial. We are accepting:
<ul>
<li>Tutorial papers
<li>Tutorial presentations (e.g. Powerpoint slides)
<li>Tutorial blog posts
</ul></p>

<p>Submitted tutorials do not have to be especially long - perhaps you have made something for a lab meeting or blog that would be interesting for the entire community?</p>

<p>Your submission can focus on any fundamental concept or technique related to MICCAI, including but not limited to registration, segmentation, atlases, computational anatomy, machine learning, deep learning, inference, computerized diagnosis, surgical navigation, surgical planning, medical simulation, medical robotics, visualization or software.</p>

<p>In a recent poll by the MICCAI Student Board, students indicated that they are especially interested in <strong>“How to make it work”, tutorials focused on implementation details not usually discussed in papers</strong>. Such materials are especially welcome by the MEC. Have you found any tips and tricks in the course of your research, perhaps some important details that were initially not obvious to you?</p>

<p>Tutorials should be comprehensible by Masters and PhD students entering the MICCAI field, to understand basic concepts and commonly used techniques. Tutorials featuring examples using open-source software are also encouraged.</p>

<p>Submission requirements:
<ul>
<li>All submissions should be in English.
<li>Word count limit: 4000 words, excluding references. Slide presentations are limited to 40 slides. Note that these are upper limits, and submissions are not required to be nearly this long!
<li>Previously published tutorial papers from past MICCAIs are not eligible.
<li>Videos not accepted this year.
</ul></p>

<p>You can also look at <a href="http://www.miccai.org/edu/materials.html"> examples of previous MEC submissions</a> (please note that videos are not accepted this year).</p>

<h1>Prize</h1>

<p>There will be one prize worth $500 sponsored by the MICCAI society. The winner will be decided through expert panel judging followed by a popular vote.</p>

<p>All submissions will first be judged by a panel of experts, using an objective evaluation of the achievement of the tutorial goal. Tutorials will be scored based on:
<ul>
<li>Accuracy of content
<li>Comprehensiveness of content
<li>Appropriate level (accessible to new Masters and PhD students)
<li>Relevance to the MICCAI community
<li>Clarity
</ul>
The top 30% of submissions will then proceed to a popular vote held at MICCAI 2018, to decide the winner.</p>

<p>Distribution of a prize is contingent on the MEC receiving at least three submissions, to ensure some level of competition.</p>




<h1> Submission</h1>
<p>Please submit your tutorial by emailing it to <a href="mailto:miccai-student-board@csail.mit.edu.">miccai-student-board@csail.mit.edu</a> with the subject line “MEC”. Please include your name and affiliation in your submission.</p>

<p>By submitting to the MEC, you (and your co-authors) agree that your submission will be made publically and freely available on the MEC website by the MICCAI Student Board.</p>



<h1> Important dates</h1>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Kick-off: MICCAI 2017
<li>Submission deadline: <strike>August 3, 2018</strike> <strong>Extended to August 10, 2018!</strong>
<li>Expert judging: August 13 to September 12, 2018
