  <h1>MICCAI Educational Challenge 2020</h1>

  <h2 style="color: red">Update for Remote Conference:</h2>
  <p style="color: red">Due to special circumstances arising from MICCAI 2020 going remote, finalists will be decided through a postgraduate student panel judging and requested to create a 3-5 minute video following acceptance introducing their submission, which will be showcased throughout the conference. The winner(s) will be decided by popular vote of the finalists at the MICCAI 2020 virtual conference. </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The MICCAI Educational Challenge will be held for the fifth time, leading up to and concluding at MICCAI 2020 in Lima, Peru. The goal of the challenge is to encourage members of the MICCAI community to create and share educational materials, covering fundamental concepts in medical image computing and computer-assisted interventions. The first prize winner of the MICCAI Educational Challenge will receive a prize of $500, sponsored by the MICCAI society. Pending sufficient submissions, a second and third place prize will also be awarded. The winner(s) will be decided by popular vote and announced at MICCAI 2020. Tutorials may be formatted as videos, papers, presentations, IPython Notebooks, GitHub sources and documentation, or blog posts.</p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>There are many fundamental concepts unique to medical image computing and computer-assisted interventions. However, finding good learning resources can be difficult, whether you are a new student or an established researcher exploring a new topic.</p>

  <p>With the MICCAI Educational Challenge we are building a library of tutorials relevant to the MICCAI community, created by and for its members. Establishing a comprehensive collection will make the field more accessible and shorten the startup time for new students. The MEC will be repeated at future MICCAI conferences, building a large corpus of educational resources for the community.</P>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the deadline? <i>August 10, 2020 (extended)</i></li>
    <li>What formats are acceptable? <i>You can submit text or video tutorials in any easily accessible format (i.e. jupyter notebook, website, docx/pptx, pdf, mp4, blog, etc...).</i></li>
    <li>Do I have to have a paper submitted to MICCAI to submit to the MICCAI Educational Challenge? <i>No, everyone is welcome and encouraged to submit to the MEC.</i></li>
    <li>Does the submission have to be anonymized? <i>This is optional and helpful to the organizers, but not required.</i></li>
    <li>Do I have to be a student to submit? <i>No, submissions are welcome from all, regardless of experience level. We only suggest that you write your submissions at a level that could be understood by a grad student trying to learn more about your topic.</i></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to participate</h2>
  You have complete flexibility in choosing the format of your tutorial. We are accepting:

  <ul>
    <li>Video</li>
    <li>Blog Post</li>
    <li>Scientific Paper</li>
    <li>IPython Notebook</li>
    <li>Powerpoint</li>
    <li>GitHub Source Code and Documentation</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="font-weight: bold">Participants are encouraged to consider preparing any blog-style submissions as a post through Medium, which will be published directly through the newly created MICCAI Educational Initiative publication on Medium. We’ve published a <a href="https://medium.com/miccai-educational-initiative/introducing-the-miccai-educational-initiative-on-medium-faa37c98d44f">getting started article</a> on the Medium channel to help you begin.</p>

  <p>Submitted tutorials do not have to be especially long (even a few well thought out slides / pages can be incredibly helpful to beginners). Perhaps you have made something for a lab meeting or blog that would be interesting for the entire community?</p>

  <p>Your submission can focus on any fundamental concept or technique related to MICCAI, including but not limited to registration, segmentation, atlases, computational anatomy, machine learning, deep learning, inference, computerized diagnosis, surgical navigation, surgical planning, medical simulation, medical robotics, visualization or software. In particular, the following topics were identified as subjects of interest in a recent <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/MICCAI/">Facebook poll</a>: (in order of most to least popular) segmentation, statistical analysis of medical images, computer-assisted intervention, and optical/histology applications.</p>

  <p>In previous polls by the MICCAI Student Board, students have additionally indicated that they are especially interested in <span style="font-weight: bold">“How to make it work”, tutorials focused on implementation details not usually discussed in papers</span>. Students also expressed a preference for submissions in the form of blogs and python notebooks. These materials are especially welcomed by the MEC. Tutorials should be comprehensible by Masters and PhD students entering the MICCAI field, to understand basic concepts and commonly used techniques. Tutorials featuring examples using open-source software are also encouraged.</p>

  Submission requirements:
  <ul>
    <li>All submissions should be in English.</li>
    <li>Word count limit: 4000 words, excluding references. Slide presentations are limited to 40 slides. Note that these are upper limits, and submissions are not required to be nearly this long!</li>
    <li>Videos should be no longer than 20 minutes</li>
    <li>Previously published tutorial papers from past MICCAI's are not eligible.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can also look at examples of <a href="materials.html">previous MEC submissions</a>.</p>

  <h2>Prize</h2>

  <p><span style="color: red">First prize is $500</span>, sponsored by the MICCAI society. The winner will be decided through expert panel judging followed by a popular vote.</p>

    <li>Appropriate level (accessible to new Masters and PhD students)</li>
    <li>Relevance to the MICCAI community</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The top 30% of submissions will then proceed to a popular vote held at MICCAI 2020, to decide the winner.</p>
  <p>Distribution of a prize is contingent on the MEC receiving at least three submissions, to ensure some level of competition. Given sufficient submissions, runner-up prizes will also be awarded to submissions that receive second and third place in the popular vote.</p>
